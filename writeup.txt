Title:  What Drives Solar Panel Uptake?

Team Members:  Mike Young, Mark Yocum, Raphael Vazquez

Project/Description:  Our project is to uncover the drivers for solar power uptake in 49 different US States (1843 counties).  
Explore whether socioeconomic status or local weather conditions are biggest drivers for whether people adopt solar panel coverage.

Questions:

1.)  Does income level matter for solar panel adoption?  Solar panels have a cost, does affordability matter
2.)  Does location matter for solar panel adoption?  Are more favorable weather conditions better suited for solar panel adoption
3.)  Any other demographic/economic correlation?  Education level
4.)  Does party affiliation correlate with solar panel coverage.

Dataset from Stanford's DeepSolar Project:  

1.) https://www.kaggle.com/tunguz/deep-solar-dataset/home
2.) Openweather API
3.) gmaps API

Tasks:

1.)  Organize Stanford dataset into workable dataframe
2.)  Breakout location data and obtain weather conditions by county from OPENWEATHER API (mean, over time?)
3.)  Can we establish consumer/demographic profiles as they relate to solar panel usage.
4.)  Visualize solar panel density and both weather and/or economic data on gmaps
